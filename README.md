## Project presentation
The name Gest'Imali comes from the abbreviation of Gestion and Imali. "Gestion" means in french "Management" and "Imali" means in Zulu "Money". From the past, We have already worked together on other projects, and our habit is to name our project using not very well-know language, that's why we choose Zulu. We also used a french word because we are.

As the project name says, we are about to create an application that allow you to manage easily your money using the 0 budget method.
